; The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
; 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
;
; The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
; (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
;
; Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
; numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
;
; Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
; natural numbers and the square of the sum.
