; Using names.txt, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,
; begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical
; value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the
; list to obtain a name score.
;
; For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is
; worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN
; would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
;
; What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
